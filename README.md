# library-TOP-Project

While working on the library, I ran into various interesting problems. One of them is creating objects and displaying these objects on the screen. <br>
The contents of the library are not stored anywhere yet.<br>
The first version of the library looks ok, but there is still work to be done.<br>

02.06.2022 - First version of library. All tasks completed.<br>
